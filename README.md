# NAO

A few modules used in my semester at SEMprog at Gothenburgs university.

Primarily programmed in Visual studio's c/c++ cli together with some imported c++ modules.

Used the NAO robot's visual input to create a video feed in c++ that was sent through an established connection with the robot. 
This feed was used to remotely control the robot with an XBOX controller to do any sort of movements; 
including controlling all external limbs and joints.
